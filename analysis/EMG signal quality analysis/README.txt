1. Open 20210809_MY_DelSys_analysis.ipynb on a Jupyter notebook (if you're using Anaconda, you can open your anaconda terminal and type in "jupyter notebook" and navigate to the folder where you saved the github folder)

2. Change path name to wherever you saved your data 

3. change your sampling frequency 

4. edit as needed

signalAnalysis.py contains get_SMR, get_SNR, get_rms, get_psd that you can run to obtain the signal quality. You need to run get_psd and put the results into get_SMR and get_SNR to get those to run.
